There's been a lot of talk of Apple crumbling. Such is the sensationalistic garbage that is the hallmark of our times.
People love to talk trash about Apple. People love to read trash about Apple. It provides almost as much enjoyment as
the rumor mills that continue to circulate fabricated predictions of Apple's next "One More Thing" product.

Yet it sells ads. And thus it exists.

The truth of the matter is that there are two real, concrete, solvable problems Apple can address in order to maintain
[the functional high ground](http://www.marco.org/2015/01/04/apple-lost-functional-high-ground).

It needs to be stated that this isn't a rebuttal to Marco or anyone else. But you probaly didn't read his article anyway.
You read a summary of a psuedo-journalist misquoting him to increase traffic on their site.

### The Radar System ###

The Radar system has been in place since before I converted to a Powerbook from a Sony Vaio Laptop (running Slackware Linux).
That puts it older that 10 years, which is ancient in terms of a web application. No wonder it is showing its age.

And yet it is _THE_ way to report bugs to Apple.

*It needs a complete re-write.*

A modern issue tracking system that allows a developer or early adopter to quickly file and tag an issue would go a long way.

Apple needs to provide more visibility into the priority of issues. You shouldn't need to "dup" an issue to let Apple
know that you are affected by it. They could let people know what they are planning to fix, when they plan to do it and
again when it has been fixed.

Apple could make an iOS app so people can file bug reports on the ride home.

Increase automation in the system. A human being shouldn't have to determine that a bug is a "dup".
Automatically close bugs that are dups. Then make the submitter explain why their bug is different.

Have a panic or crash dump trigger a submission. Do it in a way that is transparent about the data submitted but also
in a way that similar crashes can be bundled together.

I could go on but I am sure someone has already enumerated the ways to improve the Radar system. What is important is
realizing that a small amount of work here will immediately pay off.

This is a dull saw problem. We are all trying to cut down a tree with a dull saw. Sharpen the saw and we'd be on to the
next tree already.

That Radar system is bad. The point is that while it needs to be fixed, it is an easy fix.

### The Mail.app Dilemma, <br/>(Since I don't use Mail.app, I don't care that it is broken.) ###

The second problem is more complicated, but I think easily fixed as well. I think it is best illustrated with Mail.app,
hence the reason for the title.

Mail.app is broken because it wasn't fixed when in beta. Sounds obvious, but what I mean by that is I think the issues
with Mail stem for the fact very few bug reports were submitted to Apple during the beta. And that is because it is
underrepresented in the beta user's group. Since almost no one uses it, there were no bug reports, and hence when it
was released it still had a lot of issues.

I haven't used Mail.app in years. Since the release of Sparrow. When Sparrow died I grabbed something else to replace
it - but I didn't go back to Mail.

Mail is not an inovative app. It barely gets the job done these days. Probably on purpose. A radical re-design of an app
like Mail would result in complaints. The result, though, is a low number of bug reports proportional to a drop in usage
in the group of early adopters running the Yosemite betas.

*Since I don't use Mail.app, I don't care that it is broken.*

That is the problem. Apple needs beta users to care. We need to report bugs. And get them fixed.
And not to beat a dead horse, but Mail isn't useful enough to merit our attention.
There's a long list of innovative email clients for OS X: Mailbox, Airmail, Mail Pilot, Unibox to name a few. Apple is
not the leader in the email app space. That shouldn't suprise anyone.
(If there is a mistake here it was letting the Sparrow team go to Google. But that is another blog post.)

What this means, though, is that the mechanism Apple is using to field test in beta (with real world problems and data)
does not work for Mail. Just like it didn't uncover the WiFi bug.

I think Apple is aware of this and they tried to address it by inviting the general public into the OS X beta program
this year.

But that clearly didn't work. Apple doesn't need bug reports from the general public. They need bug reports from
system administrators, developers and early adopters. People with non-standard WiFi and 100GB inboxes.
There's a bunch that can be done to encourage this.

The first step is allowing people to track a bug through to resolution.
(by improving the Radar system as noted above.)

Then Apple needs a way to harness the expertise of their customers.

Maybe it is time to open source portions of the standard OS X release and place them on GitHub. Like Mail.app.
(Open source isn't good enough, it has to live on GitHub. It has to allow forks and pull requests.)

I bet the people who really care would submit fixes, nevermind submitting Radars.

### But There Are Other Problems... ###

Sure. There are problems everywhere.

The point being made about yearly releases is totally valid. It may not be sustainable.
Or maybe they just need to be smaller. It is solvable too.

It is all solvable.

I am convinced that a new issue tracker along with collaborative open source will go a long ways.
