I"ø<p>One thing that I appreciate about Apple is that they typically do the right thing.</p>

<p><em>Removing the optical drive was the right choice.</em></p>

<p><em>USB-C is amazing.</em></p>

<p><em>I am glad they dropped the headphone jack.</em></p>

<p>So itâ€™s really strange that theyâ€™ve included a USB-A charger with the new iPhones. Their pro laptops havenâ€™t
had USB-A for years. I personally have had USB-C for more than 3 years.</p>

<p>It feels totally bizarre to ship a phone that costs more than a laptop and then totally cheap out on the
charging cable. Itâ€™s just wrong.</p>

<p>Also notably absent was Appleâ€™s new AirPower wireless charging system. You canâ€™t even argue that most customers
will just buy one, because they are not even for sale.</p>

<p>The wireless charging case for the AirPods was absent as well.</p>

<p>But back to the cable.</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s no excuse to charge that kind of money for a phone and not include the proper cable.
That is not doing the right thing. :(</p>
