I"é<p>Google has a proud history of killing off the best email applications.</p>

<p>Take <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparrow_(email_client)">Sparrow</a> as an example. Its innovative approach to email set the trend for the design of email for years to come. They killed it off July 20, 2012.</p>

<p>Back then I wrote that it was a sin to kill a Sparrow. Sparrow was loved by its users and Google swallowed up the
team without offering users an alternative.</p>

<p>In that tradition today Google announced that Inbox is being discontinued and will cease to function as of
March, 2019. Similarly they have not incorporated the features of Inbox into the new Gmail.</p>

<p>Disappointing but not surprising given their track record.</p>
