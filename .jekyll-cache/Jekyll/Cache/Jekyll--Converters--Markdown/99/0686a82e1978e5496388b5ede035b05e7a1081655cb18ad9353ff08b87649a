I"_<p>I largely consider the Nexus One to be the best Android device ever made. It wasn’t trying to
copy the iPhone – it had a unique and innovative design. For this reason I have
a bit of a soft spot for HTC.</p>

<p>Similarly I dislike Samsung for both their lack of innovation and their depiction of iPhone
users in their commercials.</p>

<p>Thus, I typically will buy an HTC when I’m due for an Android upgrade. I skipped over the HTC 9
so I was overdue when the HTC 10 came out.</p>

<h3 id="first-impressions">First Impressions</h3>

<p>The screen is bright and vivid. The phone is a good size – not too large, but big enough for what I do. The Phone feels great in your hands without looking like an iPhone.</p>

<p>I find the integrated fingerprint sensor to be better than most other Android devices that I’ve
played with it terms of speed of response.</p>

<p>As a 12” Macbook owner, I am possibly over-excited about the phone’s USB-C. Partially because it means one less adaptor but also because the laptop adaptor actually charges the phone in the new super fast USB-C mode. I don’t think it’s taken more than 45 minutes to charge since I started using it.</p>

<h3 id="htc-ice-view">HTC Ice View</h3>

<p>Ice View is a super cool idea. Alter the display inside a case so that you can quickly see
information or access basic notifications.</p>

<p>It’s one of the things I like most about the customizations HTC brings to Android.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the HTC case required to use Ice View is expensive for what it is ($50) and feels ultra cheap. It’s a travesty to wrap such a nice phone in such an awful case.</p>

<h3 id="htc-android--update-soon">HTC Android – Update Soon</h3>

<p>Here’s where I am going to stop this review.</p>

<p>It’s not fare to judge a phone until you’ve used it for a month or two, especially if it has
OS customizations.</p>

<p>Once I get a little more time on the device I will update this review to include my thoughts on HTCs
customizations to Android and how the phone performs in daily use.</p>

<p>Be safe, have fun, and take care of each other.</p>

<p>– MM</p>
